# Git & GitHub

**Git**:

- Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project and manage different versions of the codebase.
- Git operates locally on your computer and doesn't require a constant internet connection.

**GitHub**:

- GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories and offers collaboration tools for software development.
- It allows developers to store, share, and collaborate on code with others.

9. **Pulling Changes**:

   - `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.

10. **Pushing Changes**:

    - `git push`: Pushes local commits to a remote repository.

11. **Creating Tags**:
    - `git tag <tag_name>`: Creates a lightweight tag at the current commit.

    - `git remote add <remote_name> <repository_url>`: Adds a remote repository.

13. **Pushing to GitHub**:

    - `git push -u <remote_name> <branch_name>`: Pushes changes to a GitHub remote.

14. **Pulling from GitHub**:

    - `git pull <remote_name> <branch_name>`: Pulls changes from a GitHub remote.

15. **Forking a Repository**:

    - Forking on the GitHub website allows you to create a copy of someone else's repository in your GitHub account.

16. **Creating a Pull Request**:
